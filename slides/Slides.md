# What this presentation is and is not

- IS
  - Brief as possible summary of my approach
  - What worked for me, will not for everyone
  - Enough know-how to help folks in their first week of learning
  - Way to get from noob to beginner or intermediate knowledge
  - Learn what's on the menu, what drink pairs with what food, not every recipe
- IS NOT
  - Approach to get deep expert knowledge
  - How to build Azure solutions (that's down the road)

# My Story
- (Visual representation of a journey)

---

# Key Ideas That Made Me Effective
- Survival
- Commitment
- Virtuous Cycle
- Iterate on best tools and techniques
---

# Survival
- Desire to provide for family without returning to a boring job
- Midlife career crisis pro

---

# Commitment
- Committing to teach a course in several weeks provides motivation
- Focus factor comes from a deadline and keeping my word
- This makes saying no to distractions & discouragement easier.

---

# Virtuous cycle
- Find next Azure certification topic that I have interest, aptitude & demand for.
- Learn all I can, and share that knowledge iwith a class.
- Feedback gives me confidence on that topic & the next one I choose.
- Azure cloud topics overlap, each success makes the next easier.
- The satisfaction of assisting others toward their career goals fuels me.

<!-- build evidence of competence by obtaining certifications, teaching, helping others, and solving problems. -->

# Iterate on best tools & techniques of study

---

# How I Prepare to Teach an Azure class

- Leverage Learn.Microsoft.com
- Choose next topic (interest, aptitude, demand)
- Take Tim Warner's 3 Legged Stool Approach

---

## Tim Warners's 3 Legged Stool
- Concepts & Theory
- Hands-On Learning
- Test Preparation


---

# Concepts & Theory

- Review Exam Page
- Review Study Guide
- Study When I Can (Phone!)
- Role -> Learning Paths -> Modules -> Units

---


# Hands-On Labs
- Git Repo (free and public)
- Lab provider (cost, MCT access)
- Follow your curiosity thru MS Learn Quickstarts & Walkthroughs

---

# Test Prep
- The point of test prep is to spotlight your knowledge gapg
- You only LEARN when you get a question WRONG
- MS Practice Assessment (free)
- Measure Up ($$$ but saves time)
- WhizLabs ($ more Qs, lower quality)
- AVOID DUMPS! 
    - Invalidates your cert
    - Only cheats yourself

---

# Tips to Deliver Training
- Teach by REFERENCE instead of REMEMBERANCE
    - Updates your skills real time
    - Teach to fish
- Baby steps to grow your confidence
    - Always choose the next step that gives you the RIGHT amount of challenge.
    - Teach ONE person
    - Teach a group
    - Make content that teaches many

---

# Your Next Steps


---

# What's your North Star?

- Envision a destination for your Azure career.
- It will change over time, you only need it to have a direction.
- Then answer this question:

---

# Choose Your Own Adventure 
## *or two, or three*

![bg contain right Choose a Career Path](img/ms-learn-roles.png)

---

# To move toward my North Star of ___________, I'll pursue the certification for the role of _________, and my next step today is to study __[module|labs|test questions]__

---

# 3 Stages of Learning
- Learning from in **institution** is the **first** phase of learning
- Learning **solo self directed** is the second phase of learning.
- Learning **alongside others** is the **third** phase of learning. Requires culture of supporting others.
