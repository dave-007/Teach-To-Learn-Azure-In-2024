# What this presentation is and is not

- IS
  - Brief as possible summary of my approach
  - What worked for me, will not for everyone
  - Enough know-how to help folks in their first week of learning
  - Way to get from noob to beginner or intermediate knowledge
  - Learn what's on the menu, what drink pairs with what food, not every recipe
- IS NOT
  - Approach to get deep expert knowledge
  - How to build Azure solutions (that's down the road)

# My Story
- (Visual representation of a journey)

---

# Key Ideas That Made Me Effective
- Survival
- Commitment
- Virtuous Cycle
- Leverage the best tools to learn Azure at cloud speed
---

# Survival
- Desire to provide for family without returning to a boring job

---

# Commitment
- Committing to teach a course in several weeks provides motivation
- Focus factor comes from a deadline and keeping my word
- This makes saying no to distractions & discouragement easier.

---

# Virtuous cycle
- Find next Azure certification topic that I have interest, aptitude & demand for.
- Learn all I can, and share that knowledge
- Feedback gives me confidence on that topic & the next one I choose.
- Azure cloud topics overlap, each success makes the next easier.
- The satisfaction of assisting others toward their career goals fuels me.

  - Concepts & Theory
  - Hands-On Learning
  - Test Preparation

---


- Understand and maximize use of Microsoft Learn

---

# Concepts & Theory

    - Review Exam Page
    - Review Study Guide
    - Study When I Can
    - Role -> Learning Paths -> Modules -> Units

# Hands-On Labs
    - Git Repo (free and public)
    - Lab provider (cost, MCT access)
    - Follow your curiosity thru MS Learn Quickstarts & Walkthroughs

---

# Test Prep
    - The point of test prep is to spotlight your knowledge gapg
    - You only LEARN when you get a question WRONG
    - MS Practice Assessment (free)
    - Measure Up ($$$ but saves time)
    - WhizLabs ($ more Qs, lower quality)
    - AVOID DUMPS! 
        - Invalidates your cert
        - Only cheats yourself.

# Tips to Deliver Training
- Teach by REFERENCE instead of REMEMBERANCE
    - Updates your skills real time
    - Teach to fish
- Baby steps to grow your confidence
    - Always choose the next step that gives you the RIGHT amount of challenge.
    - Teach ONE person
    - Teach a group
    - Make content that teaches many
